Dragon's Tale Casino Monitor
============================

This program run's alongside eGenesis' Dragon's Tale Casino 
(<http://www.dragons.tl/>) it allows you to keep track of the 
in-game chat, your private messages, system info, et cetera with
some added features that aren't in present in the game client.

This utility was heavily inspirited by Umuri's program for 
Microsoft Windows.  Unlike Umuri's utility, this program uses GTK
and runs on GNU/Linux (and other systems which have python and GTK 
available).


Usage
-----

To use the program, you'll need to turn on "log game chat to 
egenesis.bug" in your in-game settings.  Then provide the location of that 
file as an argument to dtm.

For example:

$ ./dtm ~/eClient/elaunch
